#ify is a way of finding links that people are talking about. Search engines are good for finding information relating to a string of words that articles have included in them. #ify is for finding articles that people are talking about on the topic. Instead of any website that uses the word "iPhone" in it; we look for what people are linking to with the hashtag "#iPhone". This means you see the articles that people are talking about.
